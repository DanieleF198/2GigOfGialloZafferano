# 2GigOfGialloZafferano

This project it's about experiments of the use of ILASP as a post-hoc method over black-box models such as Neural Network models, Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest neighbors.
In the repository are present the files for the creation of the used dataset of recipes (raw data obtained by GialloZafferano website), several files about studies and experiments over the data and over the black-box models performances, and finally files about experiment with ILASP.

A full description of the dataset can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/7265253#.Y2aZi3bMIuU
